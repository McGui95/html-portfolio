<h1>The Best Movies According to Rebecca</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<p><h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
This movie reminds me of autumn in New York, and is the ultimate comfort movie. I always watch it
in September to kick of my seasonal flicks. For maximum enjoyment, add homemade cinnamon buns or Chai cookies.</p>
<p><h3>Interstellar</h3>
The cinematic value of this film is immense. It is visually beautiful and the storyline
is powerful. Emotive, devastating, heart-wrenching. The acting performaces are fantastic from young to seasoned actors
playing characters with incredible depth, range, and committment.</p>
<p><h3>Promising Young Woman</h3>
This movie is empowering, devastating, gut-wrenching, and just about everything in between. With performaces
from Carey Mulligan and Bo Burnham to name just a couple, the acting depth and range 
is inescapable and poignant. Everything about this movie is jaw-dropping.</p>
